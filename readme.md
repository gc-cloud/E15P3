## Laravel PHP Project - P3

This project uses Laravel 5. In addition to the basic "out of the box" the following configuration
settings took place:  
- Bootstrap/SASS styles were compiled using Elixir and Gulp (built on top of Node.js)
- HTML helpers available
- Coffee scripts


## Above and beyond
- Compiled sass
- Using  mysql as the main data store
- Used coffee scripts??
- Used database seeders
- Installed and used HTML helpers from Laravel Collective??
- Laravel HTTP Requests??/
- The random text generator reads a text file and uses it to generate a structure of word groups called "n-grams" as a basis for generating seemingly "random" text that sounds like it was written by the same author of the text file.  
- The n-gram algorithm
uses maps and vector collections and selects words based on the probability of a particular word being used in the provided text file
Preloaded n-grams include works from Hamlet, The Beatles and ___ This algorithm.  
- Flow is from request -> routes -> controller -> view
- Custom classes and methods to support passwordgenerator
- Used Laravel's http requests methods for form handling and stickiness
